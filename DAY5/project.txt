Project: Student Management System

Description:
Create a simple Student Management System where you can perform basic operations like adding students, displaying student details, updating information, and deleting records. This project will help you practice fundamental C++ concepts while building a practical application.

Key Features:

Student Class:

Define a Student class with attributes such as name, roll number, marks, etc.
Implement getter and setter functions for accessing and modifying student details.
Data Storage:

Use a vector to store instances of the Student class, representing the student database.
User Interface:

Implement a simple console-based user interface that allows users to interact with the program.
Menu options could include adding a student, displaying all students, updating student information, and deleting a student.
Input Validation:

Implement input validation to ensure that users enter valid information (e.g., numeric roll numbers, valid marks).
Searching and Sorting:

Include functionality to search for a student by roll number and display their details.
Implement sorting algorithms to sort students based on different criteria (e.g., roll number or marks).
File Handling (Optional):

Add file handling capabilities to read student data from a file and save it to a file. This could provide persistence between program runs.
Additional Features (Optional):

Allow users to calculate and display average marks or other statistical information.
Include error handling mechanisms for unexpected user inputs.
