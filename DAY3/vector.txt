vector is a container, object in c++ standard template library
array that is dynamic and can grow and shrink as our need during runtime.
very efficient as we can use sort and other methods


SYNTAX
#include<vector>
#using namespace

vector <char> vowels   // it is a collection of characters
vector <int> test_scores // it is collection of test scores


other way

vector <char> vowels(5) // it is a collection of characters with 5 vowels

remember: vector <double > test_scores (32,80.0) // first is the size of the test scores while second is the first element of test_score
