Description:
Develop a basic to-do list program that allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and view their tasks. Use vectors to store the tasks.

Features:
Use vectors to store tasks (strings).
Implement functions to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and view the list of tasks.
Use a menu-driven approach where users can choose different options.
Include a loop to keep the program running until the user decides to exit.
Concepts:
Data types (string, vector)
Functions
Loops (for or while loops)
Conditionals (if statements)
User input and output
