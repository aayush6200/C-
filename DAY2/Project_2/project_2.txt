The area A of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying the length and the width: A = l ×
w, where l is the length and w is the width. The perimeter P of a rectangle can be calculated with P =
2(l + w). Write a program that:
 Defines a variable called length and asks the user for its value.
 Defines a variable called width and asks the user for its value.
 Computes the area of the rectangle and stores it in a variable called area.
 Computes the perimeter of the rectangle and stores it in a variable called perimeter.
 Prints out he perimeter and area.
Save your program as problem7.c. You will submit this file on Canvas.
Below is example output if the user entered 5.5 for the length and 4 for the width. Be sure to follow
the same format for your output.
Sample Output:
Enter the rectangle length: 5.5
Enter the rectangle width: 4
The area is: 22.000
The perimeter is: 19.000
Submission instructions
Create a zip file called homework2.zip containing this word document with your written answers and
your problem5.c, problem6.c, and problem7.c source files. If you do not create this zip file or follow the
instructions, you will be penalized. If you are unsure of how to create a zip file, contact one of the TAs or
me. Upload homework2.zip to Canvas. You may upload multiple times, but we will only grade the last
