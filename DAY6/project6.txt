Certainly! Here's a document outlining the basic requirements for your bank account project using C++ classes and objects:

**Bank Account Project**

**Objective:**
Create a simple program to model a bank account using C++ classes and objects. This project will help you practice defining classes, creating objects, and implementing basic operations on those objects.

**Requirements:**

1. **BankAccount Class:**
   - Create a class named `BankAccount`.
   - Include private data members for the account holder's name (`accountHolder`) and the account balance (`balance`).
   - Include a constructor to initialize the `accountHolder` and `balance` when an object is created.
   - Include member functions for depositing (`deposit`), withdrawing (`withdraw`), and displaying account information (`displayInfo`).

2. **Constructor:**
   - Implement a constructor for the `BankAccount` class that takes the account holder's name and initial balance as parameters and initializes the corresponding data members.

3. **Deposit Function:**
   - Implement a `deposit` function that takes an amount as a parameter and adds it to the account balance.

4. **Withdraw Function:**
   - Implement a `withdraw` function that takes an amount as a parameter and subtracts it from the account balance. 
     Ensure that the withdrawal does not exceed the current balance.

5. **Display Information Function:**
   - Implement a `displayInfo` function that displays the account holder's name and current balance.

6. **Main Function:**
   - In the `main` function, create at least two objects of the `BankAccount` class with different account holders 
     and initial balances.
   - Perform the following operations on the created objects:
     - Display initial account information.
     - Deposit some amount into each account.
     - Display updated account information.
     - Withdraw some amount from each account.
     - Display final account information.

**Note:**
Feel free to customize the project based on your preferences. You can add more features, 
additional member functions, or enhance the user interface as you see fit. 
The goal is to practice working with classes and objects in C++.
